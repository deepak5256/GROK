            <h2>Geological Information</h2>
            <p>Lalbagh, located in the southern part of Bangalore, India, is a renowned botanical garden that holds significant geological features. The region where Lalbagh is situated lies within the Deccan Plateau, a vast volcanic plateau formed by extensive volcanic activity around 65 million years ago. The garden itself is nestled amidst the ancient Peninsular Gneissic Complex, a rock formation comprising granitic gneisses, charnockites, and migmatites. These rocks provide a glimpse into the complex geological history of the region, showcasing the intense metamorphic processes they have undergone over millions of years. Lalbagh's geological setting also reflects the presence of residual hills and ridges, remnants of the once-extensive rocky landscape. Additionally, the garden houses a serene lake called the 'Lalbagh Lake,' which enhances the scenic beauty of the area and provides a habitat for various aquatic organisms. With its geological heritage and natural charm, Lalbagh stands as a captivating destination that combines the beauty of nature with the fascinating geological legacy of the Deccan Plateau.</p>
