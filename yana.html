            <h2>Geological Information</h2>
            <p>Yana Caves, located in the state of Karnataka, India, are a fascinating geological marvel that showcases the stunning beauty of nature. These caves are nestled amidst the verdant forests of the Western Ghats, renowned for their rich biodiversity. The Yana Caves consist of two limestone formations known as the Bhairaveshwara Shikhara and the Mohini Shikhara, rising majestically amidst the surrounding lush greenery. These towering rock formations, reaching heights of approximately 90 meters, were created millions of years ago through the process of chemical weathering and erosion. The unique geological features of Yana Caves are enhanced by the presence of natural caves within the formations, which are believed to have been carved out by underground water currents over centuries. These caves serve as a testament to the forces of nature, with their stunning stalactites and stalagmites adorning the interior chambers, creating a mesmerizing spectacle for visitors and geology enthusiasts alike. Yana Caves are not only a geological wonder but also hold great spiritual significance, as they are home to an ancient temple dedicated to Lord Shiva, attracting pilgrims and nature lovers from far and wide.</p>
