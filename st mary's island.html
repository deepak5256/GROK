            <p>St. Mary's Island, also known as Coconut Island, is a small group of four islands located off the coast of Karnataka in India. Here is some geological information about St. Mary's Island: Formation: St. Mary's Island is a result of volcanic activity that occurred millions of years ago. The basalt rock formations found on the island are believed to have been formed during the Gondwana breakup. Basalt Columns: The island is renowned for its unique basalt rock formations, which have taken the form of hexagonal columns. These columns are a result of the cooling and cracking of lava flows that occurred during volcanic eruptions. Geological Significance: St. Mary's Island is considered a significant geological site in India due to its well-preserved basalt columns. It provides valuable insights into the processes that shape volcanic landscapes and is of great interest to geologists and researchers. Age: The basalt formations on St. Mary's Island are estimated to be around 88 million years old. They are part of the Deccan Traps, a large volcanic province spread across central India. Coastal Erosion: The island's unique geological features have been shaped by coastal erosion over time. The continuous action of waves and tides has sculpted the basalt columns, creating picturesque formations along the shoreline. Geological Heritage Site: St. Mary's Island has been declared a National Geological Monument by the Geological Survey of India. This designation aims to protect and conserve its geological significance and promote scientific understanding and public awareness of its geological heritage. Biodiversity: Apart from its geological significance, St. Mary's Island is also home to a diverse range of flora and fauna. The island supports a variety of plant species, including coconut palms, mangroves, and shrubs. It is also a nesting site for several species of birds.
